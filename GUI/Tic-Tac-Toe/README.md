# Tic Tac Toe

This is a GUI based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using
Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm to find the best possible location.  

**NOTE:** Install pygame and numpy before executing `main.py`.  

**pygame**: `pip install pygame`, if that does'nt work, use your pip version.  
`pip3 install pygame` worked for me.  

**numpy**: `pip install numpy`.
