# Games
This repository contains the games that i wrote in python (well, my implementation) while getting into Artificial Intelligence. 
### 1. <a href="https://github.com/rohitbindal/Games/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe-Console" target="blank_">Tic-Tac-Toe-Console</a>  
This is the console based implementation of Tic Tac Toe game using python.
### 2. <a href="https://github.com/rohitbindal/Games/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-version1" target="blank_">Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-version1</a>
This is a more advanced implementation of Tic Tac Toe. This particular application uses **Minimax Algorithm** to maximize the score for the player **'X'**. Hence, either **'X'** wins, or it's a **TIE!**.
### 3. <a href="https://github.com/rohitbindal/Games/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-version2" target="">Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-version2</a>
This version uses **Alpha Beta** pruning on minimax algorithm.
