# Tic Tac Toe AI:version-1

Here, I implemented Minimax algorithm to maximize the score in order to win.  
Also, this is a console based implementation of the game.    

To run the game, type `$ python3 game.py` in shell.  

### References:
1. **Minimax Algorithm** is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"—to maximize the minimum gain. Originally formulated for two-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. (Yes, i copied it from Wikipedia).
